/** A reader for spike report files.
 *
 * A spike report is a text file format in which each line contains a pair of
 * spike time and cell GID values separated by one or more whitespace. Spike
 * times are floating point values in miliseconds units. Cell GIDs are unsigned
 * integer values which uniquely identify a cell within the current experiment.
 * Lines beginning with a '/' or '#' are treated as comments and ignored by the
 * parser. An example file could look like those below:
 *
 * Bluron report format :
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 * /scatter<BR>
 * 2.5     1<BR>
 * 6.6     129<BR>
 * 9.8     257<BR>
 * 9.825   385<BR>
 * </BLOCKQUOTE>
 *
 * NEST report format :
 * <BLOCKQUOTE>
 * 1       2.5<BR>
 * 129     6.6<BR>
 * 257     9.8<BR>
 * 385     9.825<BR>
